# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Just a quick note about using `JdbcCursorItemReader` in your project:

### Whatâ€™s the deal with `JdbcCursorItemReader`?
Since itâ€™s not managed (no fancy persistence context here), it doesnâ€™t play super well with JPA stuff like `JpaItemWriter` or `JpaRepository.saveAll`. At first glance, they might seem to work together just fineâ€”but hold up! If you turn on `show-sql` (set it to `true`), youâ€™ll notice a bunch of extra `SELECT` queries popping up. Thatâ€™s not great, especially if youâ€™re aiming for speedy batch inserts. It kinda defeats the whole point!

### So, what should you do?
If youâ€™re using `JdbcCursorItemReader`, do not pair with JpaWriter or JpaRepository. Use JdbcBatchItemWriter or 
if you are working on single table, you may just create a custom query to your JpaRepository to update specific columns by ids.

### TL;DR
- Use `JdbcCursorItemReader`? Stick to custom update queries.
- Use JdbcBatchItemWriter if you need to insert child rows.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
